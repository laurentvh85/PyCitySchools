In this module challenge I removed the math and reading scores for all the 9th graders who attended Thomas High School. This removed the scores of 461 students out of 39,170, this is roughly 1.18% of the total. I believe that this will only minimally affect the data as it is such a small amount of the data set. I also cleaned the data set to remove prefixes and suffexes. The cleaned data is presented in the below table. Note the NaN entries for the 9th graders at Thomas High School
